👋 Hi, I’m @Aditya-Sahu 🛠️ I live to solve problems using analytics!

For me, data analysis is a way to identify a pattern, to detect a key problem among outliers and to tell a valuable story to make an impact 📊.

Fun Facts :

✍️ I spent hours to learn SQL, Python, Google Analytics, and visualisation tools such as Power BI, Tableau and Data Studio. ✨ My greatest passion: Using data to tell stories and derive insights for business success.
